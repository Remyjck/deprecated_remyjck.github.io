I am a Master's student at the University of Oxford. I will complete my degree August and I am currently applying for PhD positions.

I am completing a master's thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Nobuko Yoshida](https://mrg.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nobuko-yoshida/) and [Dr. Lorenzo Gheri](https://sites.google.com/view/lorgheri/home) on the mechanisation of MultiParty Session Types.

I graduated with a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique in 2022.

<br>

My interests are in formal methods, deductive verification, theorem-provers, and programming languages.

I am particularly interested in improving the use of proof assistants and creating verification tools and frameworks. I am excited to see the full potential of formal verification and am hopeful that it will one day play an important role in software development.

## Research Experience

During my undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Pierre-Yves Strub](http://www.strub.nu/) on the [formalisation of ideals in commutative algebra](/research/formalizing-ideals/).

I did my undegraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Lutz Stra√üburger](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Lutz.Strassburger/) on retrieving formulaic structure from arbitrary graphs through [Modular Decomposition](/research/modular-decomposition).

I interned as a research assistant at the [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/) group at the University of New South Wales (formerly Data 61). I worked on the [Pancake](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/drivers/pancake) language, helping [boostrap a formally verified compiler](/research/bootstrapped-compiler/) for it.
