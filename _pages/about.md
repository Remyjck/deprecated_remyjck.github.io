I am a PhD candidate at the INRIA Paris' [Cambium](http://cambium.inria.fr/) team, under the supervision of [François Pottier](https://pauillac.inria.fr/~fpottier/).

My research interests are in deductive verification and programming languages. I am working on using the [Iris framework](https://iris-project.org/) in Coq for the verification of Ocaml programs.

I graduated with a MSc. in Computer Science from the University of Oxford in 2023 and a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from Ecole Polytechnique in 2022.

## Research Experience

I completed my masters thesis under the supervision of [Prof. Nobuko Yoshida](https://mrg.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/nobuko-yoshida/) and [Dr. Lorenzo Gheri](https://sites.google.com/view/lorgheri/home) on the mechanisation of MultiParty Session Types.

During my undergraduate I worked as a research assitant at the [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/) group at the University of New South Wales (formerly Data 61). I worked on the [Pancake](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/drivers/pancake) language, helping [boostrap a formally verified compiler](/research/bootstrapped-compiler/) for it.

I also worked with [Prof. Pierre-Yves Strub](http://www.strub.nu/) on the [formalisation of ideals in commutative algebra](/research/formalizing-ideals/).

I did my undegraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Lutz Straßburger](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Lutz.Strassburger/) on retrieving formulaic structure from arbitrary graphs through [Modular Decomposition](/research/modular-decomposition).
