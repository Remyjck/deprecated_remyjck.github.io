I am a Master's student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) currently applying for PhD positions. My interests are in formal methods, deductive verification, theorem-provers, and programming languages.

I graduated with a bachelors degree in August 2022 from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) in France, where I majored in Computer Science and Mathematics. I conducted my undegraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Lutz Stra√üburger](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Lutz.Strassburger/). My work was [highly commended](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/news/four-bachelors-graduates-honored-global-undergraduates-awards-2022) at the Undergraduate Global Awards, you can find the project report [here](/research/modular-decomposition).

I've recently had the opportunity to intern at the [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/) group at the University of New South Wales (formerly Data 61). I worked on the [Pancake](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/drivers/pancake) language, helping boostrap a formally verified compiler for it.


## On this site

This site is where I keep personal commentaries and summaries of my past [research](/research/).

I've also started making post(s) about things I enjoy. Check out [this one](/posts/algorithms-visualization-manim/) about visualizing algorithms with Manim.
