I am a Master's student at the [University of Oxford](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/) currently applying for PhD positions. My interests are in formal methods, deductive verification, theorem-provers, and programming languages.

I graduated in August 2022 from [Ecole Polytechnique](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en) in France where I majored in Computer Science and Mathematics. I conducted my undegraduate thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Lutz Stra√üburger](https://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Lutz.Strassburger/). My work was [highly commended](https://www.polytechnique.edu/en/news/four-bachelors-graduates-honored-global-undergraduates-awards-2022) at the Undergraduate Global Awards, you can find out more about it [here](/research/modular-decomposition).

I've recently had the opportunity to intern at the [Trustworthy Systems](https://trustworthy.systems/) group at the [University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/) (formerly Data 61). I worked on the [pancake language](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/TS/drivers/pancake), helping boostrap a formally verified compiler for it.
